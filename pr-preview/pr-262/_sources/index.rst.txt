... a user-oriented machine-learning library.

What is ``julearn``?
--------------------

At the Applied Machine Learning (`AML`_) group, as part of the Institute of
Neuroscience and Medicine - Brain and Behaviour (`INM-7`_), we thought that
using ML in research could be simpler.

In the same way as `seaborn`_ provides an abstraction of `matplotlib`_'s
functionality aiming for powerful data visualization with minor coding, we
built ``julearn`` on top of `scikit-learn`_.

``julearn`` is a library that provides users with the possibility of easy
testing ML models directly from `pandas`_ DataFrames, while keeping the
flexibility of using `scikit-learn`_'s models.

To get started with ``julearn`` just keep reading here. Additionally you can
check out our `video tutorial`_.

Why ``julearn``?
----------------

Why not just use ``scikit-learn``? ``julearn`` offers **three essential benefits**:

#. You can do machine learning with **less amount of code** than in
   ``scikit-learn``.
#. ``julearn`` helps you build and evaluate pipelines in an easy way and thereby
   helps you **avoid data leakage**!
#. It offers you nice **additional functionality**:

   * Easy to implement **confound removal**: ``julearn`` offers you a simple way
     to remove confounds from your data in a cross-validated way.
   * Data **typing**: ``julearn`` provides a system to specify **data types**
     for your features, and then provides you with the possibility to filter and
     transform your data according to these types.
   * Model **inspection**: ``julearn`` provides you with a simple way to
     **inspect** your models and pipelines, and thereby helps you to understand
     what is going on in your pipeline.
   * Model **comparison**: ``julearn`` provides out-of-the-box interactive
     **visualizations** and **statistics** to compare your models.
