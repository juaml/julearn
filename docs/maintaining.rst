Maintaining julearn
==================


Versioning
^^^^^^^^^^
julearn version numbers are as follows: *MAJOR.MINOR.MICRO*. Additionally,
development version append *devN* where N is the distance (in commits) to
the last release.

This is done automatically by `setuptools_scm`_.

This plugin reads the latest tagged version from git and automatically
increments the *MICRO* segment and appends *devN*. This is considered a
pre-release.

The CI scripts will publish every tag with the format *v.X.Y.Z* to Pypi as
version "X.Y.Z". Additionally, for every push to main, it will be published
as pre-release to TestPypi.

Releasing a new version
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Once the milestone is reached (all issues closed), it is time to do a new
release.

1. Make sure you are in sync with the main branch.

.. code-block:: bash

    git checkout main
    git pull --rebase origin main

2. Edit the file ``_version.py`` with the version of the next release. This
will be overwritten by `setuptools_scm`_, but it will make it consistent with
the version of the code in `julearn Github`_.

3. Make sure that test pass and CI won't fail after this modification:

.. code-block:: bash

    pytest -v
    flake8

4. Commit, create tag and push (replace ``X.Y.Z`` with the proper version).

.. code-block:: bash

    git commit -am "Set version to X.Y.Z"
    git tag vX.Y.Z
    git push origin vX.Y.Z
