What you really need to know
============================

The backbone of Julearn is the function :func:`.run_cross_validation`, which
allows you do all the magic. All important information needed for your 
machine learning workflow goes into this function, specified via its parameters.

But why is basically everything based on one `cross_validation` function? Well,
because doing proper cross-validation is the backbone of machine learning.

Why cross validation?

The essence of :func:`.run_cross_validation`
--------------------------------------------

:func:`.run_cross_validation` uses your **specified parameters** to train a model 
accordingly and most importantly does all specified steps in a cross-validation 
consistent manner. This helps to avoid data leakage.

Among others, the parameters passed to :func:`.run_cross_validation` include 
the specification of ...

1. ... your data and feature types (see :ref:`data_usage`)
2. ... your pipeline steps, like the learning algorithm or preprocessing steps 
   to use (see :ref:`pipeline_usage`)
3. ... how the model should be evaluated, like cross validation scheme or the 
   scoring to be used for evaluation (see :ref:`model_evaluation_usage`) 

After training the model, :func:`.run_cross_validation` either **returns** 
only the model's scores from the cross validation or both, the scores and 
the model(s) of the performed cross validation are 
(depending on your exact specifications).
