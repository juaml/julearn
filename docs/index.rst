... a user-oriented machine-learning library.

What is Julearn?
================

At the Applied Machine Learning (`AML`_) group, as part of the Institute of 
Neuroscience and Medicine - Brain and Behaviour (`INM-7`_), we thought that
using ML in research could be simpler. 

In the same way as `seaborn`_ provides an abstraction of `matplotlib`_'s
functionality aiming for powerful data visualization with minor coding, we 
built julearn on top of `scikit-learn`_.

Julearn is a library that provides users with the possibility of easy 
testing ML models directly from `pandas`_ dataframes, while keeping the
flexibiliy of using `scikit-learn`_'s models.

To get started with Julearn just keep reading here. Additionally You can 
check out our `video tutorial`_.

Why Julearn?
------------

Why not just using `scikit-learn`? Julearn offers **three essential benefits**:

1. You can do machine learning with **less amount of code** than in
   `scikit-learn`
2. Julearn helps you to build pipelines in an easy way and thereby supports you
   to **avoid data leakage**
3. It offers you nice **additional functionality**:
   
   * Easy to implement **confound removal**  # TODO Link to example
   * Data type **typing**  # TODO Link to example, name in a bette way

Julearn's backbone - :func:`.run_cross_validation`
--------------------------------------------------

The backbone of Julearn is the function :func:`.run_cross_validation`, which let's you 
do all the magic.  # TODO Add more?, link to most essential part in docu on runcv
