Welcome to julearn's documentation!
===================================

julearn is a user-oriented machine-learning library.

At the Applied Machine Learning (`AML`_) group, as part of the Institute of 
Neuroscience and Medicine - Brain and Behaviour (`INM-7`_), we though that
using ML in research could be simpler.

In the same way as `seaborn`_ provides an abstraction of `matplotlib`_'s
functionality aiming for powerful data visualization with minor coding, we 
built julearn on top of `scikit-learn`_.

This library provides users with the possibility of testing ML models directly
from `pandas`_ dataframes, while keeping the flexibiliy of using
`scikit-learn`_'s models.
