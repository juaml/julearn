    """Stratified K-Fold cross validator for regression problems.

    Stratification is done based on the discretization of the target variable
    into a fixed number of bins/quantiles.

    Parameters
    ----------
    n_bins : int
        Number of bins/quantiles to use.
    method : str, default="binning"
        Method used to stratify the groups. Can be either "binning" or
        "quantile". In the first case, the groups are stratified by binning
        the target variable. In the second case, the groups are stratified
        by quantiling the target variable.
    n_splits : int, default=5
        Number of folds. Must be at least 2.
    shuffle : bool, default=False
        Whether to shuffle each class's samples before splitting into batches.
        Note that the samples within each split will not be shuffled.
        This implementation can only shuffle groups that have approximately the
        same y distribution, no global shuffle will be performed.
    random_state : int or RandomState instance, default=None
        When `shuffle` is True, `random_state` affects the ordering of the
        indices, which controls the randomness of each fold for each class.
        Otherwise, leave `random_state` as `None`.
        Pass an int for reproducible output across multiple function calls.
        See :term:`Glossary <random_state>`.

    Notes
    -----
    Randomized CV splitters may return different results for each call of
    split. You can make the results identical by setting `random_state`
    to an integer.
