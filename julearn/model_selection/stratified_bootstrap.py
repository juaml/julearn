class StratifiedBootstrap(BaseShuffleSplit):
    """Stratified Bootstrap cross-validation iterator.

    Provides train/test indices using resampling with replacement, respecting
    the distribution of samples for each class.

    Parameters
    ----------
    n_splits : int, default=5
        Number of re-shuffling & splitting iterations.
    test_size : float, int, default=0.2
        If float, should be between 0.0 and 1.0 and represent the proportion
        of groups to include in the test split (rounded up). If int,
        represents the absolute number of test groups. If None, the value is
        set to the complement of the train size.
        The default will change in version 0.21. It will remain 0.2 only
        if ``train_size`` is unspecified, otherwise it will complement
        the specified ``train_size``.
    train_size : float or int, default=None
        If float, should be between 0.0 and 1.0 and represent the
        proportion of the groups to include in the train split. If
        int, represents the absolute number of train groups. If None,
        the value is automatically set to the complement of the test size.
    random_state : int or RandomState instance, default=None
        Controls the randomness of the training and testing indices produced.
        Pass an int for reproducible output across multiple function calls.

        Parameters
        ----------

            Training data, where n_samples is the number of samples
            and n_features is the number of features.
            Note that providing ``y`` is sufficient to generate the splits and
            hence ``np.zeros(n_samples)`` may be used as a placeholder for
            ``X`` instead of actual training data.
        y : array-like of shape (n_samples,) or (n_samples, n_labels)
            The target variable for supervised learning problems.
            Stratification is done based on the y labels.
        groups : array-like of shape (n_samples,), default=None
            Group labels for stratifying the samples used while splitting the
            dataset into train/test set.

        Notes
        -----
        Randomized CV splitters may return different results for each call of
        split. You can make the results identical by setting `random_state`
        to an integer.
